# You are responsible for editing this configuration file, setting the 
# variables to sane values.
# To help you out, the place in the source below which has the config 
# variables that you MUST update have been marked with a comment line 
# as follows:
# # @@@@@
# So, you could just search for this string '@@@@@' (excluding the quotes of course),
# and make sure you update the following config variable(s) to the sane value
